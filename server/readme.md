Simple PyPi Repository
======================

An application to store your python packages with minimal setup and basic features.

## Getting started

The recommended way to use the application is to take run the `docker-compose.yaml` file provided and run it as is.
If you need to add additional items, write a `docker-compose.[extra].yaml` where `[extra]` is any name you'd like.
Then run the compose files together.

Most settings can be put in via environment variables. A list of the important ones will be covered below
